    "text": "✈️ Final Year Project (TP): AR Wayfinding at Changi Airport\nDuring my diploma studies in Aviation Management at Temasek Polytechnic, I worked on a Final Year Project in collaboration with Changi Airport Group (CAG). The project explored the feasibility of implementing Augmented Reality (AR) wayfinding solutions to enhance passenger navigation within airport terminals.\nLarge international airports such as Changi Airport serve millions of passengers annually, and first-time or transit passengers often experience difficulty navigating terminals efficiently. Traditional static signage may not always provide intuitive or personalised guidance, especially in complex layouts. The project aimed to evaluate whether AR-based navigation could improve wayfinding efficiency and overall passenger experience.\n\n\nTechnical Approach & Software Used\nAlthough the project originated from a non-computing discipline, it involved several technical and analytical components.\nKey technologies and software used included:\n\nPython\n\nUsed for basic scripting and logic development\nSimulated routing logic, distance calculations, and directional guidance\nAssisted in processing structured data related to navigation paths\n\nAR Development & Prototyping Tools\n\nMobile AR frameworks for concept prototyping\n3D spatial mapping concepts to represent indoor environments\nUser interaction design for visual overlays and directional cues\n\nData & Productivity Tools\n\nMicrosoft Excel for data collection, comparison of navigation paths, and analysis\nPresentation and prototyping tools to communicate design concepts to stakeholders\n\n\nThe emphasis of the project was not on building a full production system, but on assessing concept feasibility, user experience, and operational value in a real-world airport setting.\n\n\n\nOutcomes & Learning\nThis project provided early exposure to: - translating real-world operational challenges into technical concepts, - applying data and logic to support navigation systems, - collaborating with an industry partner (CAG), - and communicating technical ideas clearly to non-technical stakeholders.\nThe experience sparked my interest in technology-driven solutions and laid the foundation for my subsequent pursuit of applied computing."

Line charts make it easy to observe trends, turning points, and fluctuations over time.\nUsing multiple lines allows direct comparison between SORA and bank reference rates, making differences and similarities in interest rate movements immediately visible. This approach communicates patterns more effectively than viewing raw numerical data in a table."

The goal of the project was to analyse how interest rates change over time and to understand their implications for financial products, borrowing costs, and savings decisions.\nThe chart shows a prolonged period of low interest rates, followed by a sharp increase during monetary tightening, and a subsequent gradual decline. Visualising the data made it easier to interpret interest rate cycles and relate theoretical concepts from the module to real-world financial conditions.\nOverall, this visualization demonstrates how quantitative financial data can be transformed into meaningful insights through appropriate graphical representation."
