## 🤖 Reflection on the use of GenAI

This page reflects on my experience using Generative AI (GenAI) tools to support the completion of this assessment, particularly in building and documenting my Quarto website.

---

## GenAI tool used and reason for choice

The primary GenAI tool I used for this assessment was **ChatGPT**. I chose this tool because of its ability to provide clear explanations, examples, and guidance for both technical and writing-related tasks. As someone still learning how to use Quarto and structure a website, ChatGPT was helpful in breaking down unfamiliar concepts into manageable steps.

## How GenAI helped in completing the assessment

GenAI supported my work in several practical ways throughout the assessment:

- It helped me understand how to structure a Quarto website, including how to organise pages such as the homepage, data visualization page, and reflection page.
- It provided examples of Quarto (`.qmd`) formatting, such as YAML headers, headings, and how to embed images correctly.
- It assisted in drafting clear explanations for my data visualization, especially in explaining what was visualized, the rationale for the chart choice, and the story behind the visualization.
- It helped refine my writing by improving clarity, flow, and structure while keeping the content aligned with the assessment requirements.

These examples allowed me to work more efficiently and focus on understanding the concepts rather than struggling with syntax or formatting issues.

## Benefits of using GenAI

One of the main benefits of using GenAI was **time efficiency**. It allowed me to quickly obtain guidance and examples when I encountered difficulties, reducing trial-and-error. Additionally, GenAI helped improve the clarity of my explanations, which is especially useful for written assessments that require reflection and justification.

Another benefit was that it supported learning by explaining *why* certain approaches were appropriate, such as why a particular type of chart is suitable for time-series data.

## Challenges and limitations of GenAI

Despite its benefits, there are also challenges in using GenAI. The outputs provided are not always perfect and require verification. I still needed to test code, check formatting, and ensure that the content accurately reflected my own work.

There is also a risk of over-reliance on GenAI. Without careful use, it can be tempting to accept suggestions without fully understanding them. To address this, I made an effort to review and adjust the outputs so that I remained actively involved in the learning process.

## Future use of GenAI in study or work

In the future, I believe GenAI tools will be useful for assisting with learning new technologies, debugging code, and drafting documentation or reports. In both academic and professional settings, GenAI can act as a support tool to improve productivity and understanding, especially when working with unfamiliar tools or concepts.

However, I also recognise the importance of using GenAI responsibly, ensuring that it complements rather than replaces critical thinking and independent problem-solving.

## Additional reflections

Overall, using GenAI for this assessment was a positive learning experience. It helped me complete the task more effectively while also improving my understanding of Quarto, data visualization, and reflective writing. When used thoughtfully, GenAI can be a valuable learning aid.
