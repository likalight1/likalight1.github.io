## 👋 Hello!

Hi, I’m **Kalai**, a Year 2 student studying **Applied Computing (FinTech)** at **Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT)**.  
I’m interested in **data analytics, data visualization, and building practical technology solutions** that support better decision-making.

This website was created as part of my course assessment and includes:

- A short self-introduction  
- A project page (renamed from the default “About” page)  
- A **Data Visualization** page featuring a quantitative graph with explanation  
- A **Reflection on the use of GenAI** page describing how AI tools supported my learning

Outside of my academic work, I enjoy staying active and exploring new experiences.  
Some of my hobbies include **running** and **golfing**, which help me stay disciplined and focused. More recently, I picked up **surfing** during a trip to **Bali**, which sparked a deeper interest in outdoor and adventure-based activities.

I enjoy travelling and experiencing different cultures, especially trips that involve **adventure, nature, and hands-on experiences**. These interests reflect my curiosity and willingness to step outside my comfort zone—both personally and academically.

- Writing clear and structured explanations for code and results
